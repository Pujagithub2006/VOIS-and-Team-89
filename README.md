# SilverCare: Proactive AI Platform for Elderly Assistance, Health Monitoring & Caregiver Support

VOIS Innovation Marathon 2.0

## ♦ Project Title
**SilverCare: Proactive AI Platform for Elderly Assistance, Health Monitoring & Caregiver Support**

---

## ♦ The Challenge

With the increasing elderly population, many senior citizens live alone without continuous supervision, leading to safety risks such as:

- Unnoticed Instability & Prolonged Inactivity – Gradual imbalance and abnormal movements go unnoticed. Early warning signs of health issues are missed.
- Medication Non-Adherence – Elderly individuals often forget to take medicines on time, leading to missed doses.
- Delayed Assistance – Senior citizens are unable to seek immediate help during emergencies.
- Frequent Falls – Leading cause of serious health complications.

Without an intelligent and reliable monitoring solution, senior citizens remain vulnerable to preventable injuries and delayed medical intervention.

---

## ♦ Problem Statement

To develop an automated, intelligent, and wearable monitoring system that ensures continuous health tracking, medication adherence, fall detection, and instant emergency alerts for elderly individuals.

---

## ♦ Need of the Project

Senior citizens living alone require continuous monitoring to reduce risks related to falls, missed medications, and delayed emergency response.

---

## ♦ Proposed Solution

SilverCare is an automated, intelligent, and wearable monitoring system consisting of:

- Wearable Waistband Device – Comfortable for continuous daily use.
- Multi-Sensor Monitoring – Tracks movement, posture, inactivity, and vital signs in real time.
- Smart Detection System – Processes sensor data to detect falls and abnormal behaviour with fewer false alerts.
- Medicine Reminder Feature – Sends timely alerts to ensure medicines are taken on schedule.
- Automatic Emergency Alerts – Notifies caregivers instantly via GSM or Twilio.
